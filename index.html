            <p class="description">The Tiger Swallowtail butterfly is a butterfly named obviously by the fact that is colored and patterned like a tiger. With striking marks, these guys are not easily missed! Tiger Swallowtails are native to North America and one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern states. Adult butterflies feed mostly on nectar and females will lay many broods of eggs throughout the spring and summer. Some of the best plants are the butterfly bush (deciduos shrub), lantana (annual), and milkweed (perennial).</p>

                <p class="description">This is a Bumble Bee. They are defensive and not aggressive, contrary to what people believe. Male bumblees have no stingers and the females do; though, stinging is not their priority. Contrary to what we believe, Bumble Bees can sting you twice, as they do not die after the first time (that's just honeybees). These fuzzy guys eat so much during the day, so it's important to make sure they have plenty of variety of flowers to pollinate and devour. Get some bees today to help pollinate our plants.</p>

Not to mention they're perfect for photography! </p>
